This folder contains hangman game. I have modified this game such that you can have up to two hints, and you will be penalized for entering unexpected data.\nSteps one to three are just preliminaries (it helps to read them in case you are interested in understanding how the code works. Step Five however is the actual game. hangman_art and hangman_words provides methods and classes used to facilitate the game. Baby steps, but it all seems less dificult now
. UPDATE: hangman-game.py is now the actual game with good descriptive comments and a few minor fixes.
