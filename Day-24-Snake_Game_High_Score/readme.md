/* Slight variations to the project from Day 20/21 */

A reset_ method was added to the scoreboard class and game_over() was done away with.
NOTE: The underscore after reset was  deliberate because I didn't want to override the method
in the Base Class - Turtle class - bearing the same name.


The snake class also got a reset method which we use to destroy the existing snake and create a new one 
if the snake collides with the wall. 


OTHER ACTIVITIES ON DAY 24 INCLUDE A READ AND WRITE FILE DIRECTORY WHICH WILL BE PUSHED LATER. 
As well as a Mail Merge Project.
