STATIC-TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:
Means that the values of a variable can be changed (not rigid) but the type of the variable cannot be changed.
The type is in other words - static. It makes code more robust and less likely to break. It however also makes code
more verbose.
Examples: Java C++ etc.

DYNAMIC TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:
Both values and types of a variable are dynamic. They can be changed at will.
