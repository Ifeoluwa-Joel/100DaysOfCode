main.py contains today's project. I didn't want to have to download pandas again, that is why I didn't do it in
another project entirely.

comprehension-lesson.py is the file created during the list comprehension lesson.
dictionary-comprehension.py is the file created during the dict comprehension lesson.


data-overlap.py is an exercise where I used List comprehension to create a new list containing all the numbers
that are both in file1.txt and file2.txt (It is the third exercise in today's lessons and the last exercise in list 
comprehension)

exercise-four.py is the first exercise in dictionary comprehension. The goal here is to create a dictionary where the
keys are all the words in a sentence and their corresponding values are the numbers of chars in each word.

exercise-five.py uses dict comprehension on another dict. I tried to make it readable plus I am not really in the mood
to explain it. So, if future me ever came back here looking for anything. He should go and read the code to understand
