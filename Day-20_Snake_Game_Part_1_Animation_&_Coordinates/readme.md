This project (DAY 20) actually contains the work for Days 20 and 21 which is the snake game. 
DAY 20 holds everything in the game and some other YouTube tutorials that explain some OOP concepts. 

DAY 21 can effectively be ignored because I will be moving all the tutorial files there here also. 


PS: The vintage-dvd-screensaver.py file is just my attempt to recreate the old colourful bouncing around screensaver
on DVDs. It has nothing to do with the snake game

EDIT:
The High Score  feature comes from the lesson on Day 24.
