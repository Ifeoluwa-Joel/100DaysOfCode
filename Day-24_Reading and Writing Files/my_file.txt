Hello there, my name is Ifeoluwa Joel.
I love Jesus!
I can't seem to do anything right, and I am not at peace within me.
But satan will not blow me away like chaff. I WILL PRAY

Now, that we are surrounded with so great a cloud of witnesses,
Cheering us on. Cheering us on. 
Let us run the course set before us, looking unto JESUS, the AUTHOR and FINISHER 
of our faith.
