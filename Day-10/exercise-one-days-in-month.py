Note to future self:
The code for the function is_leap was brought from Coding Exercise 3.3
in case you want to revisit that. However, the outputs were not Boolean
but rather "Leap Year" and "Not Leap Year".
It was changed to Boolean in today's exercise which reason you will see in
the context of this program.
