In <main.py>, I have set up a Telegram bot to alert me if it will rain and that is what I actually hosted on PythonAnywhere
In <rain_alert_angela>, we used the Twilio API. That's a big gun, can't afford it yet, hence why I used Telegram Bot.
In <rain_alert.py> I used it as an opportunity to refresh the Day 32 SMTP Lesson. So I am mailing myself in it.

challenge_one.py and authentication_tutorial.py are tutorial files. You can peruse them if you so wish.
