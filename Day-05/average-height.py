# My SOLUTION

# Add all items in the list
sum = 0
for i in student_heights:
  sum += i

# Count all items in the list
count = 0
for c in student_heights:
  count += 1

# Find the average and round to nearest whole number
average = sum / count
average = round(average)
print(average)


# Angela's Solution
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height

total_student = 0
for student in student_heights:
  total_student += 1

avg = round(total_height / total_student)
print(avg)
